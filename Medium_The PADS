/*Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession 
as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them 
in the following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. 
If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.*/
